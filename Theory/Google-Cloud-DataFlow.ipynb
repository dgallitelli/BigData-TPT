    "Google Cloud DataFlow represents the replacement for MapReduce by Google. It is based on *FlumeJava* and *MillWheel*, a stream engine as Storm, Samza; it writes and reads to Google Pub/Sub, just like Kafka.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of a **set of SDKs** used to define data processing jobs, among which *PCollection* (specialized collection class to represent pipeline data), *PTransform* (powerful data transforms, generic framework that apply functions across an entire data set), *I/O APIs* (pipeline r&w data to and from a variety of formats and storage technologies). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it exploits the **Google Cloud Platform managed services**, like *Google Compute Engine VMs* (to provide job workers), *Google Cloud Storage* and *Google BigQuery* (for reading & writing data). These service allow for: \n",

    "- **dynamic optimization** of the job graph for most efficient execution;\n",
    "- **resource management** as in turn on/off automatically Compute Engine VMs, according to requests, collection of logs and communication with Cloud Storage technologies;\n",
    "- **job monitoring**, showing the different stages of the data processing pipeline;\n",
    "- **native I/O adapters for Cloud Storage Technologies**, such as Cloud Storage and BigQuery\n",
